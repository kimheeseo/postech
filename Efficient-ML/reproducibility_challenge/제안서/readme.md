Dear Heeseo,

Thank you for the proposal, and sorry for the late feedback!

Regarding "2.1. dimension," this seems to be a very simple thing to check; you just look at the code, and everything will be resolve, right?

Regarding "2.2. performance," it seems like you are arguing that the result is too good to be true. Although the motivation is somewhat weak and unjustified, the performance is absolutely worth checking, as such things rarely happen. I would especially recommend spending some time to figure out if there is any hidden element of tradeoff.

I like your plans in section 3, especially 2). Have fun!

Cheers, Jaeho.
