1. There are also other concerns
1) cloud issues : if we store the model on cloud, we need to care about privacy, communication cost, latency from queues.
2) democratization : AI is a mean of production - too harmful to be monopolized.
(should AI access also be considered a "human right"? : AI 접근은 인권을 고려해야 하는가?)
3) Hardware Lottery : Bad research ideas prevail only because they are provided large - computing resources(resulting in a good absolute performance.)
: 단지 그들이 대규모 컴퓨팅 자원을 제공받기 때문에, 나쁜 연구(bad research ideas) 아이디어들이 만연하다.

Even worse, modesl just keep growing!

2. this course
scope : give you some ideas about how to answer efficiency-related questions :
1) where in ML do we need compute and memory?
2) why did models grow big from the first place?
3) how do we make a model cheaper to run?
4) how do we make a model cheaper to train?
